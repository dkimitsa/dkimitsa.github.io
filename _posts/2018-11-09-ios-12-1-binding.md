iOS 12.0 + 12.1 bindings have arrived as [PR](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/pull/335).
These was massive API update as part of iOS12 release which includes new frameworks:
- AuthenticationServices
- CarPlay
- CoreServices
- IdentityLookupUI
- NaturalLanguage
- Network

Also this release delivers lot of API changes to existing framework which, bright highlights are:
- ARKit 2
- Metal Performance Shaders;
- and [others](https://developer.apple.com/ios/whats-new/)  

Beside updating API itself `cocoatouch` receives lot of patches as result of improvement of [bro-gen]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/tags/#bro-gen) script.
(TODO: There will be detailed post about this)  
Following was improved:
- fixed lot of broken enum entires (names were generated cut or prefix was not determinated);
- exposed missing inherited constructors which added lot of missing constructors;
- applied inherited configuration that reduce number of config entries to be put in yaml;
- methods where `WithXX` was generated were mostly located and correctly renamed (*this probably might be a breaking change*);
- lot of different minor fixes to generator;

 It is to be tested for other breaking changes but I hope it will be merged back in week or two.
