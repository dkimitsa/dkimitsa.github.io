UPDATE: Commercial RoboVM [has nice tutorial about IB (still available today)](http://docs.robovm.com/tutorials/ib-basics/ib-basics.html). OOS RoboVM implementation has own differences and these are covered in this post.
It is not possible to use Java classes with Interface Builder directly. To workaround this dummy objective-c XCode project is generated. This project contains:  
UPDATE2: [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20160809131008/https://robovm.com/robovm-interface-builder-integration/)
<!-- more -->
1. objective-c representation of Java classes with exposed Outlet/Action/Collections etc;
2. resource tree which includes all resource folders specified in robovm.xml;
3. frameworks specified in robovm.xml to allow IB to see their resources as weel;

*Disclaimer.* This post doesn't cover UI creation in Interface Builder. Basic knowledge of designing in IB and objective-c would be required to understand properties, outlets etc. Check corresponding [page at Apple](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev31645f17f)

***Java level code support for Interface Builder integration***

*IBOutlet*  
To mark class member to be exposed to `Interface builder` (and iOS during runtime) it has to be marked as outlet. There is two ways for this: member annotation or setter annotation. In both cases `@IBOutlet` annotation to be used:
```java
public class MyView extends UIView {
    // member way to IBOutlet
    @IBOutlet UILabel label;

    // setter way to IBOutlet
    UIButton button;
    @IBOutlet public void setButton(UIButton button) {
        this.button = button;
    }
}
```

*IBOutletCollection*  
Similar to `IBOutlet` both member or setter options can be used. `IBOutletCollection` shell use NSArray receiving type:  
```java
public class MyView extends UIView {
    @IBOutletCollection NSArray<UIView> viewCollection;
}
```

*IBInspectable*  
It was added altogether with `@IBDesignable`. Last is not supported in RoboVM but anyway `IBInspectable` turns User Defined attributes of view into nice and shiny fields in Interface Builder. Following types can be used with this annotation as per [apple](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devf60c1c514):
> You can add the IBInspectable attribute to any property in a class declaration, class extension, or category of type: boolean, integer or floating point number, string, localized string, rectangle, point, size, color, range, and nil  

In java it is simple as bellow:
```java
public class MyView extends UIView {
    @IBInspectable UIColor color;
}
```

*IBAction*  
Marks method for generation as `IBAction` in IB shall be annotated. It shall either be parameterless or take one argument of UIControl type:
```java
public class MyView extends UIView {
    @IBAction  public void onClick(UIControl e){
    }

    @IBAction  public void onClick() {
    }
}
```

*CustomClass*  
This annotation for class is required to give native side obj-c class nice name (otherwise it will receive something like this `j_com_mycompany_myapp_MyView`) and also tells compiler to generate constructor callbacks.

***Step by step tutorial***
- Create new project: RoboVM iOS application without storyboards
- Add new class `MyView.java` and put following content into it
```java
@CustomClass("MyView")
public class MyView extends UIView {
    // member way to IBOutlet
    @IBOutlet UILabel label;

    // setter way to IBOutlet
    UIButton button;
    @IBOutlet public void setButton(UIButton button) {
        this.button = button;
    }

    @IBOutletCollection NSArray<UIView> viewCollection;

    @IBInspectable UIColor color;

    @IBAction  public void onClick(UIControl e){
    }

    @IBAction  public void onClick() {
    }
}
```

- Annotate `MyViewController` class with `@CustomClass("MyViewController")` as well. Will have benefits from pretty name in later steps

- open XCode project.
    - in IntelliJ Idea: make sure project module is selected, then follow menu Build->Open XCode
    - in Ecplipse: in project tree, right click on project root (project name), follow "Open XCode project" item in context menu  

![]({{ "/assets/2017/10/24/xcode_ib_step3.png"}})

- add new Xib to RoboVM
    - right click on `Resources` folder
    - New file...
    - select `View`
    - *IMPORTANT:* in `Save as` dialog pay attention to destination folder. It will navigate to generated `robovm-build/xcode/.ib/` folder, make sure to change it to project one `resources/`
    - save as MyView

- in opened IB change type of `view` to `MyView` in `Identity Inspector` page  

![]({{ "/assets/2017/10/24/xcode_ib_step6.png"}})

- create simple ui that consist of UILabel, two UIButtons, and 3 UIViews(for collection) and connect them to outlet as shown bellow  

![]({{ "/assets/2017/10/24/xcode_ib_step7.png"}})

- switch to `Attribute inspector` and there change `My view -> Color` attribute that is defined to value other than default. That is `@IBInspectable UIColor color;` member of MyView class;

- change `File's Owner` custom class to MyViewController in `Identity Inspector` page and connects its `view` outlet to root View (MyView)

- close XCode and navigate back to Idea/Eclipse. Modify MyViewController by removing example data to be empty one as it will be loaded from xib:
```java
@CustomClass("MyViewController")
public class MyViewController extends UIViewController {
    public MyViewController(String nibNameOrNil, NSBundle nibBundleOrNil) {
        super(nibNameOrNil, nibBundleOrNil);
    }
}
```

- modify Application Delegate to load MyViewController from xib(Main.java):
```java
@Override
public boolean didFinishLaunching(UIApplication application, UIApplicationLaunchOptions launchOptions) {
    // Set up the view controller.
    rootViewController = new MyViewController("MyView", null);
    ....
}
```

- modify `MyView.java` to put life into example:
```java
@CustomClass("MyView")
public class MyView extends UIView {
...
    @IBAction  public void onClick(UIControl e){
        label.setText("***");
        label.setTextColor(color);
    }

    @IBAction  public void onClick() {
        for (UIView v : viewCollection)
            v.setBackgroundColor(color);
    }
}
```

Run it and it shall react to button.

***Important Note:***
1. once there is any change in java file it will not be automatically applied to generated XCode project. It has to be re-generated by telling idea/eclipse to open project again (Build->Open XCode). XCode can be kept opened and will re-load items automatically (no need to close and open it)
2. generated .m/.h files shall not be edited. As these changes will not reflect java part. Generated Objective-C sources are used only to allow editing xib/storyboards and not used for any other purpose
