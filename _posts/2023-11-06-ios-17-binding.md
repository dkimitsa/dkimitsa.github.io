## iOS 17 
Bindings have been proposed as [PR758](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/pull/758).  
All CocoaTouch APIs were processed based on Xcode15.  
This update introduces changes to existing api and this might break existing code. Please open issue/communicate any problem.  
Beside existing API update it introduces support for following new frameworks: 

* Background Assets - Schedule background downloads of large assets after app installation, when the app updates, and periodically while the app remains on-device.
* Cinematic - Integrate playback and editing of assets captured in Cinematic mode into your app.
* Matter - Communicate with and control smart home devices from a variety of manufacturers.
* MediaAccessibility - Coordinate the presentation of closed-captioned data for your appâ€™s media files.
* PHASE (ios 15) - Create dynamic audio experiences in your game or app that react to events and cues in the environment.
* SensitiveContentAnalysis - Provide a safer experience in your app by detecting and alerting users to nudity in images and videos before displaying them onscreen.
 
Basic smoke test was performed. New APIs wasn't changed due huge volume of changes.
