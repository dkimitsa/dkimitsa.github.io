Updates are not tested yet, please [open issue](https://github.com/dkimitsa/robovm-robopods/issues/new) if bug found.

NB: AltPods -- are robopods kept at my personal standalone repo. This is done to prevent main robopods repo from turning into code graveyard. As these pods have low interest of community and low chances to be updated.
