title: '2.3.17 release is broken due JDK-8272564'

Just in 1h after release first reports arrived. It resulted in failure to link with messages like:
> Undefined symbols for architecture arm64: "_[j]java.lang.Object.notifyAll()V[lookup]",

Moment here: `Object.notifyAll` is final method and doesn't require `[lookup]` trampoline but quick look shows that its being invoked now with `invokeinterface` JVM instruction instead of `invokevirtual` as it was before.  

Long story short: this happen due Java18 was used for compilation on build machine. And even if we target Java8 when compiling runtime different byte code was generated due applied [JDK-8272564](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8272564).

In short term -- planned 2.3.18 release using Java 15 on host.
Also we have to support method lookup for Object methods when these invoked on interfaces as it described in [jvms-5.4.3.4 item 3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.3.4).
