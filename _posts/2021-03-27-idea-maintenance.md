Simple update that makes it working in Idea 2020.1 EAP. Deprecated API where removed and plugin has to be updated.   
Also JetBrains has fixed [the issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-242978) that was making development using Maven model complicated (hooray!).  
(Maven model is nice as allows to have code hot-swap)

Changes proposed as [PR670](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/pull/570)
