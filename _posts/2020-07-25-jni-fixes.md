[Subsurfer](https://gitter.im/MobiVM/robovm?at=5f175f7b43d5173b8c0da2a3) reported several issues related to JNI. Quick test exposed two issues:   
## Issue 1
JNI FindClass was not successful when was called from JNI_OnLoad (as result of System.loadLibrary for example)
root case: top java class on the stack was `java.lang.Runtime` and its classLoader was NULL (corresponds to `BootClassLoader`). As result user class was looked in BC list and failed.
*fix*: use systemClassLoader in case as top java class is BC class.
issue is similar to [robovm/robovm#352](https://github.com/robovm/robovm/issues/352)

## Issue 2
If application uses a dynamic framework or library that exposes JNI_OnLoad it being called in context of application image. This happens as dyld loads all symbols from libraries referenced by LC_LOAD_DYLIB command. as result library JNI_OnLoad got called on early state while JNI is not initialized yet. This caused GPF due null pointer de-reference.
fix: ignore JNI_OnLoad for application image

Fix was delivered as [PR507](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/pull/507).
